## About me
Hi ðŸ‘‹. My name is Enzo, and I am a `Javascript developer` living in Canada ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ & working remotely with the whole world ðŸŒŽ

I'm a true tattoo enthusiast, and sneakers as well.

## Tech skills
I'm a jedi of `<javascript>`, from Front-End to Back-End, I master the force

- React, Vue, vanilla js
- NodeJS, NestJS

I also mainly use Tailwind, it's a bit like the Squirtle of css, it's the best starter.

__look at this, human can lie, but code can't__
```javascript
const best_pokemon = pokemons.find(pokemon => pokemon.skill === 'âˆž')
console.log(best_pokemon) // return Squirtle
```

## Projects
In my spare time, I do two things: I look for dragon balls and I build codes stuffs... unfortunately I can't show you the dragon balls yet, too dangerous.

```javascript
In return, here is a list of my personal projects:
