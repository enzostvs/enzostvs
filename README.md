# Welcome to My GitHub Profile! 🚀✨

## About Me 🌟

Hi there! 👋 I'm **Enzo**, a passionate JavaScript developer living in Canada 🇨🇦 and conquering the world from my desk! 🌍

When I'm not coding, you can find me:
- Getting inked (tattoo enthusiast here! 🎨)
- Hunting for the latest sneakers (just don't ask me to choose between my kicks and my laptop! 🐟)
- Daydreaming about owning a dragon ball scanner (seriously, where is Goku when I need him? 🤯)

## Tech Skills: The Good Stuff! 💻✨

I'm a full-stack developer with a serious case of JavaScript fever! 🔥

**Frontend:**  
React, Vue.js, Vanilla JS, and all the modern tools that make the web sing and dance! 🎶

**Backend:**  
Node.js, NestJS – I’m your go-to for building scalable, robust APIs that make your app rocket! 🚀

**Design:**  
Tailwind CSS is my secret weapon – clean, efficient, and ready to slay any design challenge! 🌟

_(and of course a bit of magic through Figma first 🪄)_

## My Projects: The Lab Where Magic Happens! 🔧✨

In my spare time, I’m either:
- Looking for dragon balls (still TBD when I’ll find the 7th one 🐉)
- Building cool stuff that makes the internet a better place

Here are some of my favorite creations:  
*Stay tuned – I'm adding more soon!*

## Fun Facts About Me! 🎉

- I once built a calculator using React that can solve world hunger (well, maybe not, but it’s still cool! 🧮)
- My spirit animal is a Pokémon – and no, it’s not Pikachu (spoiler: it’s Squirtle! 🐢)

Looking forward to meeting you and perhaps sharing some dragon ball hunting tips! 🦁
